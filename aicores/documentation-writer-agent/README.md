# Documentation Writer Agent — AI Core

> **AI Core** | Documentation Engineering | Author every doc type, from any source, in any format.

The **Documentation Writer Agent** is a full-stack documentation engineering AI Core. It converts source code, Jira epics, Confluence pages, OpenAPI specs, and PRDs into accurate, structured documentation — API references, architecture docs, ADRs, release notes, READMEs, tutorials, user guides, Word documents, PDFs, and PowerPoint presentations.

## MCP Connections

| Server        | URL                                  | Used By                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atlassian` | `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp` | `atlassian-sourcer`, `doc-engineer`, `c4-architect` |

The Atlassian MCP connection enables fetching user stories, epics, acceptance criteria, and Confluence pages directly into the documentation workflow. Authentication uses OAuth; the agent calls `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` first on every session to obtain the correct `cloudId`.

## Agents

### `doc-engineer`

**Description:** Primary Documentation Engineer. Executes the full research → draft → review → format workflow for any documentation task. When the request is ambiguous or under-specified, runs a structured **Phase 0 Intake** — asking what to document, who the audience is, the reader's goal, available sources, and preferred output format — all in one prompt so the user can answer in a single reply.

**Triggers:** `"write docs for"`, `"document this"`, `"generate release notes"`, `"create a README"`, `"review these docs"`, `"write a tutorial"`, `"create an ADR"`, `"use the Jira stories"`, `"pull from Confluence"`

**Skills loaded:** `authoring-technical-docs`, `authoring-api-docs`, `authoring-architecture-docs`, `authoring-release-docs`, `authoring-user-docs`, `editing-docx-files`, `processing-pdfs`, `editing-pptx-files`, `automating-docs-updates`, `sourcing-from-atlassian`

**Examples:**

```
"Document the /payments REST endpoint from the OpenAPI spec"
"Write release notes for v2.3.0 from these Jira tickets"
"Create a README that lets a new developer clone and run the project in under 30 seconds"
"Review the existing architecture docs and give me a quality verdict"
"Write a tutorial for our new auth SDK — audience is external developers"
"Generate a Word document version of this API reference"
"I need some documentation" ← triggers Phase 0 intake to gather scope
```

---

### `atlassian-sourcer`

**Description:** Precision research agent that fetches Jira user stories, epics, acceptance criteria, sprint tickets, and Confluence pages via MCP, then returns a structured **source bundle** for downstream agents.

## Skills

### `authoring-technical-docs` ⭐ *(load first)*

**Description:** Core documentation engineering action. Provides the quality framework, style rules, and multi-pass workflow (research → draft → review → format) that all documentation must follow.

**When to use:** Always. This is the foundation every other skill builds on. If no domain skill matches, this skill alone is sufficient.

**Key features:**

- Diátaxis framework classification (Tutorial / How-To / Explanation / Reference)
- Six quality dimensions: Accuracy, Completeness, Usability, Consistency, Readability, Structure
- Gap detection with blocker/warning/info severity
- YAML frontmatter requirements for every document

**Example:**

```
"Review this existing API reference doc — give me a quality verdict"
"Write documentation for this Python module (general, no specific type needed)"
```
