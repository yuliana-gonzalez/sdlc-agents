# Security Agent — AI Core

> **AI Core** | Developer Security Governance | From code review to compliance, threat modeling to DevSecOps pipelines.

The **Security Agent** is a comprehensive developer security governance AI Core. It covers the full spectrum of application security: reviewing code for vulnerabilities, modeling threats, designing secure architectures, hardening CI/CD pipelines, managing compliance frameworks, and building organization-wide security programs.

## MCP Connections

> The Security Agent does not require MCP connections by default. All skills operate on code, architecture descriptions, and documentation you provide directly.
>
> **Exception:** `devsec-publishing-compliance-report` requires the **Atlassian MCP** connection to publish reports to Confluence.

## Agents

### `devsec-code-review`

**Description:** Security-focused code reviewer with deep knowledge of OWASP Top 10 (2025), ASVS 5.0, CWE Top 25, and 14 secure coding domains. Reviews code for vulnerabilities, produces prioritized findings with in-language code fixes mapped to CWE IDs, and generates secure code review checklists. When the request lacks code or security scope, runs a structured **Phase 0 Intake** — asking what to review, the trust boundary, data sensitivity, ASVS target level, and specific concerns — all in one prompt before proceeding.

**Triggers:** `"review this code for security"`, `"is this code secure?"`, `"check for XSS/SQLi/CSRF"`, `"scan for deprecated libraries"`, `"identify EOL components"`, `"what ASVS level should I target?"`

**Skills loaded:** `devsec-reviewing-code-for-security`

**Examples:**

```text
Review this authentication module for security vulnerabilities
Is this SQL query vulnerable to injection? Show me the fix
Generate a secure code review checklist for our Node.js API
What ASVS level should we target for our healthcare app?
Scan this requirements.txt for deprecated or vulnerable libraries
Review this JWT implementation — check for common weaknesses
```

### `devsec-threat-modeling`

**Description:** Threat modeling facilitator using STRIDE methodology. Identifies threats to systems and architectures, documents attack surfaces with CWE mappings, and derives testable security requirements before code is written.

**Triggers:** `"threat model this"`, `"what could go wrong with this design?"`, `"identify threats to my API"`, `"help me do STRIDE"`, `"what are the attack surfaces?"`, `"security review of my architecture"`

**Examples:**

```text
Threat model this microservices architecture diagram

```

---

### `devsec-compliance-framework`

**Description:** Security compliance advisor mapping controls to standards (ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIST SSDF, OWASP ASVS, GDPR, CCPA). Produces gap analyses, control mapping tables, compliance logs, and security metrics dashboards. Can publish any compliance artifact directly to Confluence.

**Triggers:** `"map our controls to ISO 27001"`, `"what controls do I need for SOC 2?"`, `"NIST SSDF alignment"`, `"security gap analysis"`, `"GDPR Article 32"`, `"MTTD/MTTR metrics"`, `"audit preparation"`, `"publish compliance report to Confluence"`

**Skills loaded:** `devsec-managing-compliance-frameworks`, `devsec-publishing-compliance-report`

## CWE/MITRE Integration

All security findings and threat model entries produced by this AI Core are mapped to [CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)](https://cwe.mitre.org) at **Base or Variant level**, following the [MITRE CWE Usage Guidance](https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/cwe_usage/guidance.html).

Key rules enforced:

- Only ALLOWED or ALLOWED-with-review CWEs are cited
- Pillar-level and Category-level CWEs are never used for mapping
- Weakness language (root cause) is used, not impact/exploit language
- Every finding header includes: `CWE-{ID} – {Name} [Base/Variant, ALLOWED]`
